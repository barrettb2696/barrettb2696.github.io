        <h1>Brandon Barrett - Computer Science ePortfolio</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a U.S. Navy veteran, software developer, and recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. With a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and databases, I specialize in designing efficient, secure, and scalable solutions across a range of platforms. This ePortfolio showcases my growth, technical accomplishments, and passion for clean, well-structured code. Whether I'm enhancing a full-stack web application or optimizing a 3D graphics rendering system, I strive to bring clarity, performance, and professionalism to everything I build.

            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>Completing my coursework in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a transformative experience that helped me define my strengths, sharpen my goals, and prepare for a successful career in the software development field. Throughout the program, I developed technical and professional skills that allow me to approach problems with confidence, communicate effectively in technical environments, and design scalable, efficient, and secure software systems.</p>
        
            <p>Creating this ePortfolio was more than just a capstone exercise—it gave me the opportunity to look back and recognize how far I've come as a developer. I chose three artifacts that represent distinct areas of growth: software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and database development. Together, these projects highlight my ability to work across the stack and adapt to different technical challenges with clean, well-organized code and thoughtful solutions. Each artifact not only met the requirements of its original course, but has since been enhanced to reflect best practices and professional standards.</p>
        
            <p>Throughout the program, I've had multiple opportunities to collaborate in team environments. In courses like IT-315 and CS-250, I worked with peers on shared codebases using version control tools like Git, practiced pair programming, and participated in project planning meetings that mimicked real agile development cycles. These experiences taught me the value of clear communication, code documentation, and task management, all of which are essential for success in real-world software development teams.</p>
        
            <p>Another key area of growth was stakeholder communication. In courses like CS-340 and CS-330, I had to design software with a specific user or business requirement in mind—such as building dashboards, structuring outputs for a non-technical audience, or simulating user permissions. These moments challenged me to frame technical decisions in practical, user-focused terms, which is an essential skill when working with clients, managers, or other departments.</p>
        
            <p>In terms of technical skills, I've gained deep experience in software design, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I applied concepts like modular architecture, time complexity analysis, and performance optimization in multiple assignments, especially in my authentication system and 3D rendering project. The database courses taught me both SQL and NoSQL development, and I applied those skills to build a full-stack dashboard connected to a MongoDB backend. I also became more aware of modern security principles, including credential encryption, secure database configuration, and proper access control—skills I used when upgrading authentication logic and protecting sensitive data.</p>
        
            <p>This ePortfolio brings together the strongest examples of those skills. The first artifact demonstrates my grasp of object-oriented design, OpenGL rendering, and performance-focused refactoring. The second shows how I can apply data structures like HashMaps and enums to enhance logic and secure sensitive workflows. The third reflects my ability to integrate a frontend dashboard with a backend database using secure and scalable practices, while improving user interaction with caching and error handling.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue building on this foundation by pursuing opportunities in backend development, full-stack engineering, or DevOps. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can combine system-level thinking with user-focused problem solving—roles that reward clean architecture, security awareness, and a drive to keep learning.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, this program and portfolio helped me turn a passion for problem solving into a professional identity. I'm leaving this degree program not just with academic experience, but with job-ready skills, real-world projects, and the confidence to succeed in the next stage of my career.</p>
