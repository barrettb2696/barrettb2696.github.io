        <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>For the Software Design and Engineering category, I chose to enhance my 3D Programming Project originally created for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The artifact was a strong fit because it demonstrates key software engineering principles such as object-oriented design, modularity, and the use of mathematical transformations for 3D rendering. The project features a detailed 3D desk setup with objects like a monitor, speaker, keyboard, mouse, and two posters, which made it a great foundation for demonstrating more advanced design and implementation skills.</p>
      
        <p>The planned enhancements focused on improving both functionality and design quality. First, I added an entirely new object—a coffee mug—to the scene. This showcased my ability to extend the codebase without disrupting existing components, highlighting my understanding of modular development. The mug was created using a cylinder mesh for the body and a torus mesh for the handle, both reused from existing shape assets. This demonstrated not just technical skill, but also an efficient use of available resources, which is an important part of good software design.</p>
      
        <p>Next, I improved the lighting and shading system by enhancing the <code>SetupSceneLights()</code> function. I introduced adjustable Phong-style lighting parameters, such as specular intensity and focal strength, to create a more realistic rendering environment. This reflects my ability to not only work with existing graphics features but to optimize and improve them for better user experience and visual quality.</p>
      
        <p>Finally, I refactored several parts of the codebase to improve performance and maintainability. I replaced older search methods for materials and textures with <code>std::unordered_map</code> hash maps. This significantly reduced lookup time and improved the modularity of the code. I also fixed a resource management bug in <code>DestroyGLTextures()</code> that was incorrectly using <code>glGenTextures()</code> instead of <code>glDeleteTextures()</code>. Along with that, I improved error handling in <code>CreateGLTexture()</code> to give clearer feedback when an image file failed to load.</p>
      
        <p>Overall, this artifact and the enhancements I made demonstrate my skills in clean, modular software design, efficient code structuring, and thoughtful integration of new features. It represents my ability to build on an existing system, apply improvements that reflect real-world software engineering practices, and create a more dynamic and scalable application.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Through this enhancement process, I gained a deeper understanding of real-time rendering pipelines and memory management in OpenGL. One of the biggest challenges was troubleshooting the texture deletion bug—it required careful debugging and a better understanding of how OpenGL handles texture IDs. Refactoring with hash maps also helped reinforce my understanding of data structures and their impact on performance. These enhancements align with course outcomes related to applying software engineering principles, optimizing performance, and extending existing systems in a scalable way.</p>
